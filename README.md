DotNetMvc_Images

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains a.NET MVC web application built using ASP.NET MVC 7 and Visual Studio 2022. It includes registration, login, Home, Contact, and About pages out of the box. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions, so feel free to reach out if you have any ideas on how to improve this project. To start, clone the repository and run the application in Visual Studio. The browser will open the application's home page, with the address bar pointing to localhost:port#, the standard hostname for your local computer.
